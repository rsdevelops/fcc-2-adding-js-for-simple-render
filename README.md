# 2 - Changing the DOM with JavaScript

This repo holds one of a series of examples of JAMstack sites from a freeCodeCamp video. The video, "Introduction to JAMstack" is available to view for free on freeCodeCamp.

## About this example

The second of our 6 code examples, this example builds on [example 1](https://findthat.at/jamstack/ex1) to add some simplistic client-side JavaScript. Things are still very simple here, but we use this example to deploy an iteration to our hosting environment.

In the video, we show the pre-built, ready-to-serve assets to out hosting environment, using the drag and drop facility to create a new immutable deployment within [Netlify](https://netlify.com/drop?utm_source=github&utm_medium=fcc-examples-pnh&utm_campaign=devex). The video also introduces different types of rendering, explaining:

- Client-side rendering
- Server-side rendering (At request time)
- Server-side rendering (At build time)


## Local development

To work on this example locally, you can clone the repository and simply start editing. There is no build step or any pre-requisites.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philhawksworth/fcc-2-adding-js-for-simple-render
```
